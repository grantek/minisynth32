# Minisynth 32

A 3D-printable MIDI synthesiser inspired by the Roland MT-32 and
[clumsyMIDI](https://github.com/gmcn42/clumsyMIDI), and powered by the
[mt32-pi](https://github.com/dwhinham/mt32-pi/wiki) MT-32 emulator.

## Warnings

**NO WARRANTY is provided, and no guarantee that all or any of the parts will
fit together. 3D printing is time-consuming and an art at the best of times.**

However, if you're stuck or have a question, feel free to open an issue on
GitHub, and the worst you'll get is sympathy.

## Assembly Notes

Check the [Bill of Materials](minisynth32-bom.csv) for all of the parts needed,
and the [project wiki](https://github.com/grantek/minisynth32/wiki) for the
build guide with pictures, a [text-only copy](build-guide.md) is included in
this repository.

## News

This is "Version 2.0" of the Minisynth 32, the previous version had a simpler
faceplate with 2 large, easy to print buttons. If you're looking for the old
version, see the "ms32-v1.0" tag/release.
