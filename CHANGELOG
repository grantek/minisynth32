PCB rev 1.1
Changes to rear board:
- cutaway to support Raspberry Pi 3B/3B+
- shorter distance to edge of PCB on DIN port side to allow more access to Pi mounting hole
- F_PANEL header moved away from Pi camera connector
- C3 changed to correct radial footprint, order of C3/C4 to the DAC fixed
- Added MIDI pin diagram to bottom mask (top of minisynth), and all header names
- Increased resistor pitch to 10.16m

Changes to front board:
- Fixed B1 and B2 order
- Connected all SPDT switch pads for strength and redundancy

PCB rev 1.0
Initial revision, rear breakout board only works with Raspberry Pi 3A+, doesn't immediately work with 3B/3B+ (PCB collides with USB ports)
