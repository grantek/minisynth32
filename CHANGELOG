20210531 Change to base STL and BOM: Pi mounts use M2.5 bolts

Previously the Pi was mounted to the base using 2 or 4 M3 screws into brass
knurled threaded inserts. The mounting holes in the Pi are actually 2.9mm,
and designed for M2.5 bolts. M3 screws _may_ work (they did for me) by slightly
widening the hole, but this carries a risk of damaging your Pi.

The Pi is now mounted to the base in the same way as the faceplate is, using
bolts through the base with nuts to hold the board down. The BOM still
specifies M3 bolts and nuts for the faceplate and MIDI port, but M2.5 bolts may
work as well.

PCB rev 1.1
Changes to rear board:
- cutaway to support Raspberry Pi 3B/3B+
- shorter distance to edge of PCB on DIN port side to allow more access to Pi mounting hole
- F_PANEL header moved away from Pi camera connector
- C3 changed to correct radial footprint, order of C3/C4 to the DAC fixed
- Added MIDI pin diagram to bottom mask (top of minisynth), and all header names
- Increased resistor pitch to 10.16m

Changes to front board:
- Fixed B1 and B2 order
- Connected all SMD switch pads for strength and redundancy

PCB rev 1.0
Initial revision, rear breakout board only works with Raspberry Pi 3A+, doesn't immediately work with 3B/3B+ (PCB collides with USB ports)
