Front PCB rev 2.0

10-button interface for more authentic front face. Only the 2 working switches
for mt32-pi need to be installed, but there are positions for 10 tactile
switches. With a slightly modified front face model and more printed buttons,
these switches can be installed without being connected (purely for novelty)
or used for future expansion/experimentation.

Switches used are now through-hole TL59N switches, so that I don't have to
say the project is only "mostly" through-hole.

Rear PCB rev 1.2
No real difference to v1.1, the version bump is mainly pedantic. The outer
board dimensions (short edges only) were snapped to a metric grid to match the
new front PCB.

At time of writing this version only appears in the panelised "front plus rear"
pcbnew file, the standalone board is still left at v1.1 with unchanged
dimensions.

20210531 Change to base STL and BOM: Pi mounts use M2.5 bolts

Previously the Pi was mounted to the base using 2 or 4 M3 screws into brass
knurled threaded inserts. The mounting holes in the Pi are actually 2.9mm,
and designed for M2.5 bolts. M3 screws _may_ work (they did for me) by slightly
widening the hole, but this carries a risk of damaging your Pi.

The Pi is now mounted to the base in the same way as the faceplate is, using
bolts through the base with nuts to hold the board down. The BOM still
specifies M3 bolts and nuts for the faceplate and MIDI port, but M2.5 bolts may
work as well.

PCB rev 1.1
Changes to rear board:
- cutaway to support Raspberry Pi 3B/3B+
- shorter distance to edge of PCB on DIN port side to allow more access to Pi mounting hole
- F_PANEL header moved away from Pi camera connector
- C3 changed to correct radial footprint, order of C3/C4 to the DAC fixed
- Added MIDI pin diagram to bottom mask (top of minisynth), and all header names
- Increased resistor pitch to 10.16m

Changes to front board:
- Fixed B1 and B2 order
- Connected all SMD switch pads for strength and redundancy

PCB rev 1.0
Initial revision, rear breakout board only works with Raspberry Pi 3A+, doesn't immediately work with 3B/3B+ (PCB collides with USB ports)
